All summary statistics are from meta-analyses of the fertility phenotypes.

To limit the possibilities of identifiability,  no sample allele frequencies are provided (the reported allele frequencies are from HapMap2 2 CEU (r22.b36)).

We provide results from six separate analyses:
1. Summary data file - AgeFirstBirth_Pooled.txt – Association results (AFB). All cohorts except 23andMe. 
2. Summary data file - NumberChildrenEverBorn_Pooled.txt  - Association results (NEB). All cohorts except 23andMe. 
3. Summary data file - AgeFirstBirth_Female.txt – Association results (AFB), Female only. All cohorts except 23andMe. 
4. Summary data file - NumberChildrenEverBorn_Female.txt  - Association results (NEB), Female only. All cohorts except 23andMe. 
5. Summary data file - AgeFirstBirth_Male.txt – Association results (AFB), Female only. All cohorts except 23andMe. 
6. Summary data file - NumberChildrenEverBorn_Male.txt  - Association results (NEB), Female only. All cohorts except 23andMe. 

Each file consists of the following columns:
SNPID: SNP rs number.
CHR: chromosome number.
POS: base pair position.
A1: effect allele.
A2: other allele.
Freq_HapMap: A1 frequency in HapMap2 (CEU).
Zscore: Standardized regression coefficient. 
Pvalue: Nominal p-value of the null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero.
