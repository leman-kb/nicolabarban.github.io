We are pleased to announce the Summer School: An introduction to combining social science and molecular genetic research.

*When: June 26-30, 2017*

*Where: Nuffield College, University of Oxford, UK*

 
The programme consists of morning lectures by top scholars in the emerging field of ‘sociogenomics’, including **Dalton Conley (Princeton)**, **Ben Domingue (Stanford)**, **Melinda Mills (Oxford)**, **David Steinsaltz (Oxford)**, **Meena Kumari (Essex)**, **Cecilia Lindgren (Oxford)**. Afternoon lectures consist of hands-on computer lab training by Oxford-based researchers Nicola Barban, Felix Tropf, Stine Møllegaard, Maria Christodoulou and Melissa Smart (Essex), and Yanchun Bao (Essex) from the Understanding Society.
 
The course will equip students with a unique insight into the emerging topic of sociogenomics and the most cutting-edge methodological techniques in this area of research. The focus will be on understanding the key substantive research questions in this area, an overview of UK data that is increasingly available, hands-on computer lesson of how to work with genetic data, and an introduction into the current methodological techniques used in the field.
 
 
**The deadline for applications is March 30, 2017.**
