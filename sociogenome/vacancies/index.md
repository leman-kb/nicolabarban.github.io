**Postdoctoral Fellow in Sociogenomics**

We are seeking an outstanding quantitative researcher to work in our multidisciplinary project on sociogenomics and human reproductive research, funded by the Wellcome Trust and John Fell Fund of the University of Oxford and led by Professor Melinda Mills. The research objectives for this postdoctoral project aim to: (1) develop a multifactor theoretical and empirical measurement model to understand how genetic and socio-environmental factors impact and interact to influence reproductive traits; (2) apply cutting-edge statistical genetic techniques to understand the relationship of genetic traits associated with behavioural and medical traits related to reproduction; (3) bridge genetic and socio-environmental research to understand gene-environment interaction; and; (4) identify causal mechanisms.

The successful candidate will be expected to engage in advanced independent research within the remit of the project. More specifically, he/she will shape and carry out research in the larger projects focussing on one or more of the themes listed above. 

The successful candidate will hold or expect to obtain a PhD in sociology, demography, economics, statistics, medical sciences or another relevant discipline. Training and expertise in analysing secondary data, strong quantitative analysis skills are essential. Candidates will be required to show evidence of developing a track record of excellent quality publications in peer-reviewed academic journals.

The post is full-time on a fixed-term contract, for 24 months starting as soon as possible.

Applications, including a covering letter, CV and the names of 3 referees, should be submitted by 12.00 noon on 8 February 2017.
