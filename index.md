I am a Senior Research Fellow  in the Department of Sociology at the University of Oxford.  I am also  a Research Fellow at Nuffield College. I did my  PhD in Statistical Sciences at the University of Padova, Italy. Before moving to Oxford, I worked as postdoctoral researcher at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands.

My main interest is to combine genomics and social sciences. I am currently working on [**Sociogenome**](http://www.sociogenome.com), an exciting project on gene-environment interactions in fertility behaviour funded by the European Research Council (PI, Melinda Mills). I am also coordinating a large meta-GWAS on fertility traits [link](https://osf.io/53tea/). 


## Research interests:

* Quantitative methods in social sciences.
* Sociogenomics 
* Demography
* Social interactions
* Life course
